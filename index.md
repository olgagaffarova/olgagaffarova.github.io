[QS World University Rankings 2026](/sample_page)
It is easy to assume that the best universities are simply those with the highest rankings at the very top of the QS list.  
However, not everyone can realistically enroll in the top 10 due to high competition and cost. This project is motivated by the idea that high-quality education can also be found beyond the top tier when you know what metrics to review.

[Citibike Strategy](/sample_page2)
Bike-sharing systems like CitiBike often face uneven bike distribution. This project explores how the Pareto principle can help predict and optimize bike rebalancing by identifying the stations that drive most supply-demand imbalances. By analyzing net bike flow, I aimed to build a simple predictive strategy to improve availability and reduce operational inefficiencies.
