    <p>
      It is easy to assume that the best universities are simply those with the highest rankings at the very top of the QS list.
      However, not everyone can realistically enroll in the top 10 due to high competition and cost.
      This project is motivated by the idea that high-quality education can also be found beyond the top tier when you know what metrics to review.

    <p>
      Bike-sharing systems like CitiBike often face uneven bike distribution.
      This project explores how the Pareto principle can help predict and optimize bike rebalancing by identifying the stations
      that drive most supply–demand imbalances.
      By analyzing net bike flow, I aimed to build a simple predictive strategy to improve availability and reduce operational inefficiencies.

### Influenza Planning in the United States

    <p>
      This project analyzes CDC mortality data from 2009–2017 to identify when and where demand is likely to peak. By evaluating both total deaths and per-capita mortality rates, I pinpointed high-priority states and recommended a phased regional deployment strategy aligned with seasonal flu patterns. The findings were visualized in a Tableau storyboard.
